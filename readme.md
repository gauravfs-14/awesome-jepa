A carefully curated collection of high-quality tools, libraries, research papers, projects, and tutorials centered around Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) — a self-supervised learning paradigm introduced by Yann LeCun and Meta AI that learns representations by predicting representations of the future from representations of the present, without reconstructing pixels or tokens. This repository serves as a comprehensive, well-organized knowledge hub for researchers and developers exploring the next frontier of self-supervised learning and representation learning.

JEPA represents a fundamental shift in how AI systems learn representations. Unlike traditional generative models that reconstruct inputs, JEPA learns to predict abstract representations of the future state of the world from abstract representations of the present. This approach enables more efficient learning, better generalization, and the ability to handle complex, high-dimensional data without the computational overhead of pixel-level reconstruction.

To keep the community up-to-date with the latest developments, this repository is continuously enriched with newly published JEPA-related papers, real-world use cases, and open-source implementations. From foundational architectures to advanced variants like Hierarchical JEPA (H-JEPA) and applications in vision, language, and multimodal learning, the collection aims to highlight both foundational ideas and emerging best practices.
